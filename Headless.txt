In order to link a local window to a headless server to avoid ClearMap2 issues, we took the following route:1. Install xpra (https://www.xpra.org/) on both remote/server and local computers2. On the server, initiate an empty display port from the terminal:`xpra start :X` where x is any integer3. Add the following lines to the beginning of ClearMap, prior to importing the ClearMap.Environment:```import osos.environ['DISPLAY'] = ':X'```Note that at this point all ClearMap modules will be loaded, but default visualization steps provided by ClearMap will not work.  The next step should allow the GUI to be generated locally.  However, several users report issues with GUI display4. From your local terminal, attach the empty display port.  When the GUI is subsequently called, it should display locally:xpra attach ssh://me@myserver/X
